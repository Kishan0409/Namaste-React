Assignment 2 (Episode-2)
1. What is NPM ?
NPM is a node package manager. It doesn't have a fullform.

2. What is Parcel/Webpack? Why do we need it?
Parcel/Webpack are build tools for webapps. These tools improve performance by bundling,reducing the file size and optimizing the code.

3. What is .parcel-cache?
It is a folder that contains the cache files in it. 
It stores information about the project when we build it, so that it doesn't need to re-parse or re-analyze things from scratch again.
This makes parcel fast in development mode.

4. what is npx?
Npx is a tool that id used to execute packages.

5. What is the difference between dependency and devDependency?
Dependencies : These are the dependencies required by the application in production.
DevDependencies : These are the dependencies required by the application for local development and testing.

6. What is tree shaking?
Tree shaking is process of removing the unwanted code that we do not use while developing the application.
In computing, tree shaking is a dead code elimination technique that is applied when optimizing code.

7. What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
package.json:
This file is mandatory for every project
It contains basic information about the project
Application name/version/scripts

package-lock.json:
This file is automatically generated for those operations where npm modifies either the node_module tree or package-json.
It is generated after an npm install
It allows future devs & automated systems to download the same dependencies as the project.
it also allows to go back to the past version of the dependencies without actual â€˜committing the node_modules folder.
It records the same version of the installed packages which allows to reinstall them.
Future installs will be capable of building identical description tree.
